
## About

This repository contains the code used to simulate and analyse different extension scenarios of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in Benin.

This repository is associated with the following manuscript: J. Lemant, C. Champagne, W. Houndjo, J. Aïssan, R. Aïkpon, C. Houetohossou, S. Kpanou, R. Goers, C. Affoukou, E. Pothin.  "**Modelling to support decisions about the geographic and demographic extensions of seasonal malaria chemoprevention in Benin**", available as a [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.25.24306333v1).

Assumptions are defined in [0modelling_parameters](https://github.com/SwissTPH/BeninSMC/tree/main/0modelling_parameters).

Scripts to run the calibration to prevalence estimates as well as output datasets are in [1calibration](https://github.com/SwissTPH/BeninSMC/tree/main/1calibration).

Scripts to run future simulations (including past simulations with a large population) are in [2future_simulations](https://github.com/SwissTPH/BeninSMC/tree/main/2future_simulations).

Scripts to generate all results and figures are in [3results](https://github.com/SwissTPH/BeninSMC/tree/main/3results).
